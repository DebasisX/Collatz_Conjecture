# Collatz_Conjecture
 This conjecture has been around for a while and no one knows why it is the way it is. I made this program just to hear the voice of the random series..  It generates sin waves of frequency as provided by the conjecture and have tuned the fade-in and fade-out just a bit for a melodious output.
